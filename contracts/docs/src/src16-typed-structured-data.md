# SRC-16: Typed Structured Data

The following standard sets out to standardize hashing and signing of typed structured data. This enables secure off-chain message signing with human-readable data structures.



## Motivation

Signing data is a well-understood problem for simple bytestrings, but real-world applications often require signing complex, structured messages. Without a standard method for hashing structured data, developers risk implementing their own solutions, which could compromise security.

This standard aims to:

Provide a secure, standardized method for hashing structured data
Enable clear presentation of structured data for user verification during signing
Support complex data types that mirror Sway structs
Enable domain separation to prevent cross-protocol replay attacks
Define a consistent encoding scheme for structured data types
